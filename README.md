## My Project

For my survival analysis project, I will use the data from the Mayo Clinic  trial in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver conducted between 1974 and 1984. The dataset contains a total of 312 PBC patients.

## Install R packages

To install the packages needed for my analysis, from the project folder you can run

``` bash
make install
```

## Execute the analysis

To execute the analysis, from the project folder you can run

``` bash
make report.html
```

This will create a file called `report.html` output in your directory that contains the results.

## Makefile help

To get some helpful information about the Makefile, from the project folder you can run

``` bash
make help.html
```
